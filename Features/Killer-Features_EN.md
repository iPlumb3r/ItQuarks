Killer-Features
==

Preamble
-
Modeling paradigms often tend to "compartmentalize" the __"things"__ ...   
... by making each __"thing"__ in the model belong to a well-defined category.   
(Without allowing it to belong to another category).  

Experience shows that it is not good practice to do this!

What are they ?
-
That's why the 3 following features can be considered as "killer-features", because they participate in the "decompartmentalization" of the models:   
(The IDs - not significant - of concepts used in the table below refer to those defined <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/KeQuarks/tree/master/Concepts">here</a>)

            <td>Each #0 (Topic) could be classified by several #2 (Type)</td>
            <td>All differents complementary views on the same Knowledge Base</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>A same things could be #0 (Topic) in a context and a #2 (Type) in another context</td>
            <td></td>

It's really a shame that these features are mostly considered as "advanced" features ...   
... whereas they are in fact the _minimun vital_ to be able to build knowledge bases in phase with reality !!!

Preferred labels
-
For this section the preferred labels used are the following:
* #0 (Topic): ITEM/Individual
* #1 (Tuple): LINK/Statement
* #2 (Type): TYPE/Class

In short !
-
* __Link Reification__ : Allows the same "thing" to be a LINK/Statement & an ITEM/individual at the same time.
* __Multiple Type__ : Allows the same "thing" to be both TYPE/Class A & TYPE/Class B (or even other TYPES/Classes)
* __Meta-Modelling__ : Allows the same "thing" to be both an ITEM/Individual & a TYPE/Class
