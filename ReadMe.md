Introduction
-
__KeQuarks__ is the develiverable of the _"holy grail" quest_ for __Knowledge Engineering "Elementary Particles"__ ;-)

The goal of this initiative is to identify and define __relevant__ Concepts & (Meta)-Models for designing __poweful__ Model(s).
* <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/KeQuarks/tree/master/Concepts">Concept</a> identification is done by selecting them in already existing relevant <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/KeQuarks/tree/master/Paradigms">Paradigms</a> (Benchmark approach)
* Concept definition is done via an onto-terminology approach, where __Concepts__ & __Terms__ which denote them are "decoupled" (in order to avoid - or at least limit - any terminological debate). This kind of approach allows both a common consensus about __Concepts__, but allows also everybody to use its prefered __Terms__. 


Motivation
-
In order to build flexible and robust business application defined in the scope of the <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/BigPicture">SEAMLESS</a> initiative, we need to design a very releven model ...   
... just because the structure of the "Brick" (Meta-)Model used to build a "House" (Application) directly impact its architecture.

Content
-
In this repository we are first listing <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/KeQuarks/tree/master/Concepts">Concepts</a>, <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/KeQuarks/tree/master/Features">Features</a> (allowed by Concept patterns) & <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/KeQuarks/tree/master/Paradigms">Paradigms</a> ...   
... and then we are trying to determine :
* Which Concept pattern allow a given Feature
* How Paradigms are classified according Concept patterns : <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/KeQuarks/blob/master/Concepts_x_Paradigms.md">here</a>
* Which Paradigm allow which Feature : <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/KeQuarks/blob/master/Features_x_Paradigms.md">here</a>




Where Used
-
The __KeQuarks__ (Meta-)Model should be used for the __KeQuarks__ initiative (Just because KeQuarks should be "self-descriptive" : Dogfooding At Works ;-)
