==

__KeQuarks__ is the develiverable of the _"holy grail" quest_ for __Knowledge Engineering "Elementary Particles"__ ;-)

The goal of this initiative is to identify and define __relevant__ Concepts & (Meta)-Models for designing __poweful__ Model(s).
* <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/KeQuarks/tree/master/1_Semantic">Concept</a> identification is done by selecting them in already existing relevant <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/KeQuarks/tree/master/2_Paradigms">paradigms</a>
* Concept definition is done via an onto-terminology approach, where concepts & terms which denote them are "decoupled" (in order to avoid - or at least limit - any terminological debate). This kind of approach allows both a common consensus about concepts, but allows also everybody to use its prefered terms.
