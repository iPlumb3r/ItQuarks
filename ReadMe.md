The "M" Ontology
==
Target ideal Ontology for building semantic-driven PLM (Prodcut Lifecycle Management) applications

Mantra
-
In order to design a Product, you also need a Product ...
... so the ontology and the meta-ontology should be the same !

Motivation
-
Specifying a kind of Ontology skeleton for being able to quickly define an Ontology for a given purpose ...
... based on strong design rule and robust business invariants
