==

__KeQuarks__ is the develiverable of the _"holy grail" quest_ for __Knowledge Engineering "Elementary Particles"__ ;-)

The goal of this initiative is to identify and define __relevant__ Concept(s) & (Meta)-Models for designing __poweful__ Models.
* <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/KeQuarks/tree/master/1_Semantic">Concepts</a> identification is done by selection in already existing <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/KeQuarks/tree/master/2_Paradigms">paradigms</a>
* Concept definition is done via an onto-terminology approach (where concepts & terms which denote them are "decoupled")
