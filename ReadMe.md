==

__KeQuarks__ is the develiverable of the _"holy grail" quest_ for __Knowledge Engineering "Elementary Particles"__ ;-)

The goal of this initiative is to identify and define __relevant__ Concepts & (Meta)-Models for designing __poweful__ Model(s).
* <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/KeQuarks/tree/master/1_Semantic">Concept</a> identification is done by selecting them in already existing relevant <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/KeQuarks/tree/master/2_Paradigms">paradigms</a>
* Concept definition is done via an onto-terminology approach, where concepts & terms which denote them are "decoupled" (in order to avoid - or at least limit - any terminological debate). This kind of approach allows both a common consensus about concepts, but allows also everybody to use its prefered terms. 


Motivation
-
In order to build flexible and robust business application defined in the scope of the <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/BigPicture">SEAMLESS</a> initiative, we need to design a very releven model ...   
... just because the structure of the "Brick" (Meta-)Model used to build a "House" (Application) directly impact its architecture.

Where Used
-
The __KeQuarks__ (Meta-)Model should be used for the __KeQuarks__ initiative (Just because KeQuarks should be "self-descriptive" : Dogfooding At Works)

And also some initiatives/projects in this <a href="http://hubject.net/iPlumb3r/GitHub/BigPicture.html">"Big Picture" Map</a>
