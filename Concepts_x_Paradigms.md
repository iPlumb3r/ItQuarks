Concepts x Paradigms
==

This section is about "How each <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/KeQuarks/tree/master/2_Paradigms">Paradigms</a> is dealing with <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/KeQuarks/tree/master/1_Semantic">Concepts</a> ?"

2 importants axis allows to make disctions betweens paradigms :
* How this paradigm deal with Tiples : Oriented (2-Ary) OR Non Oriented (2-Ary & N-Ary) Tuples ?
* How this paradimg deal with "Property" : As Pointer, As Type or As Tuple ?

And those 2 disctinction are able to combinate togheter :
