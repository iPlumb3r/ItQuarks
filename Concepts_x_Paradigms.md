Concepts x Paradigms
==

This section is about "How each <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/KeQuarks/tree/master/2_Paradigms">Paradigms</a> is dealing with <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/KeQuarks/tree/master/1_Semantic">Concepts</a> ?"

2 importants axis allows to make disctions betweens paradigms :
* How this paradigm deal with Tiples : Oriented (2-Ary) OR Non Oriented (2-Ary & N-Ary) Tuples ?
* How this paradimg deal with "Property" : As 2nd Concept, As Type or As Tuple ?

__Note__ : Oriented Tuple make sens only in the case of 2-Ary Tuples, Non Oriented Tuples make sense both for 2-Ary Tuples & N-Ary-Tuples
__Note__ : "Property As Is" mean that Property are considered as a new concept. "Property As Type" or "Property As Tuple" mean than Property are treated by using already existing concepts.

And those 2 disctinctions are able to combinate togheter :
